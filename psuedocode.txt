Lawnmower:
Input:
n = number of light dark disk pairs in a list.

int numberofswaps = 0
For n
    integer i = 0
    While i < n-1
        If disk at index i is dark AND disk at index i+1 is light
            swap disks at index i and i+1
            increment numberofswaps
        increment i
    end While
    While i > 0
        If disk at index i is light AND disk at index i-1 is dark
            swap disks at index i and i-1
            increment numberofswaps
        de-increment i
    end While
end for
    
output:
sorted list of disks

big O complexicity = O(n^2)


Alternate:
Input:
n = number of light dark disk pairs in a list.

int numberofswaps
for n
    for (n*2)+1
        If disk at index i is dark AND disk at index i+1 is light
            swap disks at index i and i+1
            increment numberofswaps
    end for
end for
    
output:
sorted list of disks
